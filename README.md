# R
I find the R Studio environment very comfortable. Even if I am presented with a challenge that I know nothing about, I feel confident enough to attempt it in R Studio. Yes, there are other programming languages with much more efficient ways of problem solving and I will attempt to work in them. But till then, I will upload my work here.
