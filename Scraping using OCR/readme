The code describes a way to scrape pseudo-element protected information from a website.
I did this while handling an Independent Project for database creation. 
The steps involve saving the code of the webpage and taking the screenshot after scrolling down to trigger JS events.
This is followed by extracting information stored in normal elemnets from code while extracting the protected information using screenshot.
After some manual checking and cleaning, I obtained the desired output.
